## Intro to Functional Programming
Repo for storing lessons and homeworks from the [course](https://courses.edx.org/courses/course-v1:DelftX+FP101x+3T2015/course/).

#### Motivation
To continue learning about FP, have a better understanding of what a pure functional language, such as `Haskell`, means and
keep applying functional concepts in `Kotlin` and `Swift`.
